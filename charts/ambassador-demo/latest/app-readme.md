# Ambassador Demo

[Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io) is an open source, Kubernetes-native API gateway.  

In this demo when a request is sent through Ambassador, Ambassador sends the request to an endpoint based on the data in Consul.  

The service registered in Consul is the Automium Demo application: https://github.com/automium/reactor.
